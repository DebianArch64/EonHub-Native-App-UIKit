# EonHub-Native-App-UIKit
A UIKit port of Casp's open sourced SwiftUI version. This is for people who are begineers, this has been done in the simpliest way possible. Porting for iOS 10 or lower requires a change to the scene and appdelegate, nothing major.

# About Me
I am DebianArch and I love advanced UI design and coding in apps. I am mainly a SwiftUI version because of how fast you can get things done compared to UIKit and what you can do completely programmatically. Make sure to check out my upcoming Scarlet Project which will be an absolute game changer to current 3rd party AppStores. It'll also feature new things like notifications, a dynamic DNS, auto color detection, and so much more.
